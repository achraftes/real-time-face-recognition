# Real-Time Face Recognition

This project implements a real-time face recognition system using Python and OpenCV. The goal of this project is to detect and recognize faces from live video streams, providing an efficient and scalable solution for various applications, including security systems, attendance systems, and personalized user experiences.

## Key Features:
- **Real-time face detection:** Identifies faces in live video streams with high accuracy.
- **Face recognition:** Matches detected faces with a pre-trained database for identification.
- **Gender detection:** Identifies the gender of the detected face.
- **Age prediction:** Estimates the age of the detected face.
- **OpenCV-based:** Built using OpenCV for computer vision tasks, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Scalable and efficient:** Designed to handle multiple faces and work in real-time environments.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV** (for image processing and face detection)
- **Haarcascades** for pre-trained face detection
- **Face recognition algorithms** for accurate identification
- **Gender and Age Prediction Models** for detecting gender and estimating age
